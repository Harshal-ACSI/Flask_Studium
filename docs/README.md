### Description

Studium is an open-source website that aims to help students study and learn.
It combines the simplicity of Flask with an intuitive interface to provide
access to educational materials, tools, and resources that promote better learning experiences.

### Usage

Studium is a website built on the [Flask Framework](https://github.com/Harshal-ACSI/Flask_Studium/tree/master/library).
Hence, to use it locally, you will need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3131/) installed
(version 3.13.1 recommended).
You can clone this repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harshal-ACSI/Flask_Studium.git
```

**or**

<sub>This only works with [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/)</sub>

```bash
gh repo clone Harshal-ACSI/Flask_Studium
```

**or**

You can directly [download as zip file](https://github.com/Harshal-ACSI/Flask_Studium/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

It is recommended that you use a virtual environment for this project.

```bash

source myvenv/bin/activate
```

You will also need to install the dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](../requirements.txt).
