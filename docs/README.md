version 3.13.1 recommended).
You can clone this repository using:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Harshal-ACSI/Flask_Studium.git
```

**or**

<sub>This only works with [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/)</sub>

```bash
  gh repo clone Harshal-ACSI/Flask_Studium

It is recommended that you use a virtual environment for this project.

```bash
  pip install virtualenv

```

You will also need to install the dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](../requirements.txt).
