<h3 id="what are atoms">What are Atoms?</h3>
<p>
    To learn what atoms do, we need to learn what they exactly are. Atoms are the
    building blocks of matter. More specifically, they are
    <u>
        the smallest constituent unit of matter that possess the properties of the
        chemical element.<sup
    ><a href="https://byjus.com/chemistry/atoms-and-molecules/">[1]</a></sup
    ></u
    ><br/><br/>
    Okay. We now know the meaning of an atom, but what exactly is it? An atom is
    made of three parts (called <u>subatomic particles</u>):<br/>
    - Protons<br/>
    - Neutrons, & <br/>
    - Electrons<br/>
    Let's dive deeper into the particles in an atom.
</p>

<h4 id="the protons">The Protons</h4>
<p>
    The proton is a positively charged particle in an atom. Hence, we say that it
    <u>has a charge of +1<i>e</i></u
    >. The word "proton" came from the Greek word, "pr&omacr;tos" which means
    "first" and was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920 (a
    hydrogen nucleus only has one proton). A proton is also said to have the mass
    of 1.672 621 925 95 x 10<sup>-27</sup> kg.<sup
><a href="https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?mp">[2]</a></sup
>
</p>
<h4 id="the neutrons">The Neutrons</h4>
<p>
    Neutrons, unlike electrons and protons,
    <u>have no electric charge at all (so, it has a charge of 0<i>e</i>)</u>.
    Neutrons are also very slightly larger and heavier than protons.
    <u
    >Neutrons and protons, commonly called nucleons, are bound together in the
        dense inner core of an atom, the nucleus</u
    >, where they account for 99.9 percent of the atom's mass.
    <sup><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/neutron">[3]</a></sup>
</p>
<h4 id="the electrons">The Electrons</h4>
<p>
    Electrons <u>have a negative electric charge (charge of -1<i>e</i>)</u>. But
    what makes them special is that they
    <u>are not bound to the nucleus of the atom</u> and have a ridiculously small
    mass of 9.10938356 x 10<sup>-31</sup> (Approximately 1/1837 times the mass of
    a proton), causing to whizz around the nucleus. This also allows an atom to
    lose and gain electrons. More on that later... <br/>For now, remember an
    important rule:<br/>
    In a stable atom,
    <u>the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons.</u>This makes
    the atom's overall charge neutral (0<i>e</i>).
</p>

<h3 id="models of atoms">Models of Atoms</h3>
<p>
    There are many models of atoms that are used for different purposes these
    models can help us visualize atoms much easier. Here are a few models that
    have been proposed over the years:

<div class="box" id="solid sphere model">

            <div class="horizontal-space"></div>
            <div class="horizontal-space"></div>
            John Dalton had the greek idea that atoms are indivisible ('Atom' came
            from the Greek word 'Atomos' which means indivisible). However, his theory
            is wrong as there are subatomic particles, and therefore this model is not
            used for examining parts of an atom.<br/>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="box" id="plum pudding model">
    <u>Plum Pudding Model</u> J.J.Thomson (1904)<br/>
    <div style="display: flex">
        <div>
            <img
                    src="/static/images/Atom(Plum_Pudding_Model).svg"

            <div class="horizontal-space"></div>
            <div class="horizontal-space"></div>
            J.J.Thomson discovered electrons inside atoms (for which he won the Nobel
            Prize) and produced the Plum Pudding Model where the electrons are
            scattered in a cloud of positive charge. However, this model is rarely
            used today as it states that an atom does not contain a nucleus.

            <div class="horizontal-space"></div>
            Ernest Rutherford discovered that atoms have nuclei by firing positively
            charged alpha particles into an atom. He found out that the atom is mostly
            empty space and that the positive charge is concentrated in the center of
            the atom.

<div class="box" id="planetary model">
    <u>Planetary Model</u> Neils Bohr (1913)<br/>
    <div style="display: flex">
        <div>

            <div class="horizontal-space"></div>
            <div class="horizontal-space"></div>
            Neils Bohr modified the nuclear model by stating that electrons move
            around the nucleus in fixed orbits. It is clear and very easy to
            understand. Hence, this is a widely used model used to explain concepts
            such as valency. We will be using this model later.

        <div>
            <div class="horizontal-space"></div>
            <div class="horizontal-space"></div>
            Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger stated that electrons do follow fixed orbits and
            claimed that it was impossible to find the exact location of an electron.
            Instead, we have orbitals, which are areas of an atom where electrons are
            more likely to be. This is the currently most accurate model of an atom.

<h3 id="atomic number and mass">Atomic Number & Mass</h3>
<p>
    Atoms of different elements can be separated using their atomic number and
    mass.
    <u
    >The atomic number of an atom is the number of protons (or electrons) in an
        atom. The atomic mass is the total number of protons and neutrons in an
        atom.
    </u>
</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>
    Atoms are the smallest constituent unit of matter that possesses the
    properties of the chemical element and is made up of three subatomic
    molecules:<br/>
    - Protons [Positively Charged]<br/>
    - Neutrons [Neutrally Charged]<br/>
    - Electrons [Negatively Charged]<br/>
    There is always the same number of electrons as protons in a stable atom. An
    Atom's atomic number is the number of protons in the atom, and the atomic mass
    is the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom.
