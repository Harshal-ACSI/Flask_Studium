<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>Organic chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, composition, reactions, and preparation of
    carbon-containing compounds. Most organic compounds contain carbon and hydrogen, but they may also include any
    number of other elements (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, halogens, phosphorus, silicon, sulfur). Originally limited to the
    study of compounds produced by living organisms, organic chemistry has been broadened to include human-made
    substances (e.g., plastics).<sup><a
