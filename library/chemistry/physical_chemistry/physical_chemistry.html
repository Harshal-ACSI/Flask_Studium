<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>
    Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic and microscopic phenomena in
    chemical systems in terms of the principles, practices, and concepts of
    physics such as motion, energy, force, time, thermodynamics, quantum
    chemistry, statistical mechanics, analytical dynamics, and chemical
    equilibrium.<sup

><br/><br/>
    Put, Physical Chemistry examines:<br/>
    - How matter behaves on a molecular and atomic level, &<br/>
    - How chemical reactions occur<sup

<h3>Application</h3>
<p>The research performed by physical chemists is an increasingly small part of industrial research. Accordingly, fewer
    physical chemists are being hired by industry and government labs. Still, physical chemistry provides broad training
    and positions for students to work in a variety of scientific careers, such as:

    Emerging fields of material science and molecular modeling. Combining the traditional mathematical rigor of
    physical chemistry with the practicality of these fields offers new and exciting possibilities.
    Careers in analytical chemistry. Here, you'll work to understand the fundamental processes involved in analytical
    techniques and look for ways to enhance and expand them. </p>
