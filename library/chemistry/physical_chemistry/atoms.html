<h3>
    What are Atoms?
</h3>
<p>To learn what atoms do, we need to learn what they exactly are. Atoms are the building blocks of matter. More
    specifically, they are <b> the smallest constituent unit of matter that possess the properties of the chemical
        element.</b><br/><br/>
    Okay. We now know the meaning of an atom, but what exactly is it? An atom is made of three parts (called <b>subatomic
        particles</b>):<br/>
    - Protons<br/>
    - Neutrons, & <br/>
    - Electrons<br/>
    Let's dive deeper into the particles in an atom.
</p>

<h4>The Protons</h4>
<p>The proton is a positively charged particle in an atom. Hence, we say that it <b>has a charge of +1<i>e</i></b>. The
    word
    "proton" came from the Greek word, "pr&omacr;tos" which means "first" and was given to the hydrogen nucleus by
    Ernest
    Rutherford in 1920 (a hydrogen nucleus only has one proton). A proton is also said to have the
    mass of 1.672 621 925 95 x 10<sup>-27</sup> kg.<sup><a href="https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?mp">[1]</a></sup>
</p>
<h4>The Neutrons</h4>
<p>
    Neutrons, unlike electrons and protons, <b>have no electric charge at all (so, it has a charge of 0<i>e</i>)</b>.
    Neutrons are also very slightly larger and heavier than protons.
    <b>Neutrons and protons, commonly called nucleons, are bound together in the
        dense inner core of an atom, the nucleus</b>, where they account for 99.9 percent of the atom's mass. <sup><a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/science/neutron">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<h4>The Electrons</h4>
<p>Electrons <b>have a negative electric charge (charge of -1<i>e</i>)</b>.
    But what makes them special is that they <b>are
        not bound to the nucleus of the atom</b> and have a ridiculously small mass of 9.10938356 x 10<sup>-31</sup>
    (Approximately 1/1837 times the mass of a proton), causing to whizz around the nucleus.
    This also allows an atom to
    lose and gain electrons.
    More on that later... <br/>For now, remember an important rule:<br/> In a stable atom, <b>the number of protons is
        equal
        to the number of electrons.</b>This makes the atom's overall charge neutral (0<i>e</i>).</p>

<h3>Models of Atoms</h3>
<p>There are many models of atoms that are used for different purposes these models can help us visualize atoms much
    easier. Here are a few models that have been proposed over the years:</p>
<div class="horizontal-space"></div>

<div class="box">
    <b>Solid Sphere Model</b> John Dalton (1803)<br/>
    <div style="display: flex;">
        <div>
            <img src="/static/images/Atom(Solid_Sphere_Model).svg"
                 alt="Yikes! Couldn't get an image! Check your internet connection."
                 style="width:100px;height:100px; margin: 10px 20px 10px 10px;"/>
        </div>
        <div>
            <div class="horizontal-space"></div>
            <div class="horizontal-space"></div>
            <div class="horizontal-space"></div>
            John Dalton had the greek idea that atoms are indivisible
            ('Atom' came from the Greek word 'Atomos' which
            means indivisible).
            However, his theory is wrong as there are subatomic particles, and therefore this model is not used for
            examining parts of an atom.<br/>

<div class="box">
    <b>Plum Pudding Model</b> J.J.Thomson (1904)<br/>
    <div style="display: flex;">
        <div>
            <img src="/static/images/Atom(Plum_Pudding_Model).svg"
                 alt="Yikes! Couldn't get an image! Check your internet connection."
                 style="width:100px;height:100px; margin: 10px 20px 10px 10px;"/>

            <div class="horizontal-space"></div>
            <div class="horizontal-space"></div>
            J.J.Thomson discovered electrons inside atoms (for which he won the Nobel Prize) and produced the Plum
            Pudding Model where the electrons are scattered in a cloud of positive charge. However, this model is rarely
            used today as it states that an atom does not contain a nucleus.

            Ernest Rutherford discovered that atoms have nuclei by firing positively charged alpha particles into an
            atom.
            He found out that the atom is mostly empty space and that the positive charge is concentrated in the
            center of the atom.

            <div class="horizontal-space"></div>
            <div class="horizontal-space"></div>
            Neils Bohr modified the nuclear model by stating that electrons move around the nucleus in fixed orbits. It
            is clear and very easy to understand.
            Hence, this is a widely used model used to explain concepts such as valency. We will be using this model
            later.

        <div>
            <div class="horizontal-space"></div>
            <div class="horizontal-space"></div>
            Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger stated that electrons do follow fixed orbits and claimed that it was impossible to
            find
            the exact location of an electron. Instead, we have orbitals, which are areas of an atom where electrons are
            more likely to be. This is the currently most accurate model of an atom.

<h3>Atomic Number & Mass</h3>
<p>Atoms of different elements can be separated using their atomic number and mass. <b>The atomic number of an atom is
    the
    number of protons (or electrons) in an atom. The atomic mass is the total number of protons and
    neutrons in an atom.</b></p>
