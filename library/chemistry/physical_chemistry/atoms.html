<h3>
    What are Atoms?
</h3>
<p>To learn what atoms do, we need to learn what they exactly are. Atoms are the building blocks of matter. More
    specifically, they are <b> the smallest constituent unit of matter that possess the properties of the chemical
        element.</b><br/><br/>
    Okay. We now know the meaning of an atom, but what exactly is it? An atom is made of three parts (called <b>subatomic
        particles</b>):<br/>
    - Protons<br/>
    - Neutrons, & <br/>
    - Electrons<br/>
    Let's dive deeper into the particles in an atom.

<h3>The Protons</h3>
<p>The proton is a positively charged particle in an atom. Hence, we say that it has a charge of 1<i>e</i>. The word
    proton came from the Greek word, "pr&omacr;tos" which means "first" and was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest
    Rutherford in 1920 (a hydrogen nucleus only has one proton and nothing else!). A proton is also said to have the
    mass of 1.672 621 925 95 x 10<sup>-27</sup> kg.<sup><a href="https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?mp">[1]</a></sup>
